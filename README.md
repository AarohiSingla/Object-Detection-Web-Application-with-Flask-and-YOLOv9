##### 2- Install Flask:
While still in the terminal or command prompt, type:
<b>pip install Flask </b>

##### 3- Navigate to the Code Directory:
Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where your code is located. For example:
<b>cd path/to/your/code/directory </b>

#### 4- Run the Python Script:
